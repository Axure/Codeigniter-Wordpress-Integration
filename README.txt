-------------------------------------

Disclaimer: These are simple examples that were presented in WordCamp Greece 2011. In real life you should work more on the code provided.
Also, the ci-plugin trick is kindly provided to the world by The Daylight Studio (http://www.thedaylightstudio.com/)

Provided the three ways to integrate Codeigniter and Wordpress.

First is the blog-header trick which is pretty simple. We include wp-blog-header.php into codeigniter's index.php 
After we do that we're able to insert Wordpress Codex Code inside our views.

Second is a Model that uses Wordpress Database as a second database which performs some basic queries on the Wordpress database

Third is the great code that the daylight studio provides
